# Example configurations showing different mapping and transformation scenarios

# Example 1: Simple joint reordering
# Use when robots have joints in different order
reorder_example:
  joint_mapping:
    0: 2  # Leader joint 0 -> Follower joint 2
    1: 0  # Leader joint 1 -> Follower joint 0  
    2: 1  # Leader joint 2 -> Follower joint 1
    3: 3  # Leader joint 3 -> Follower joint 3 (same)
    4: 5  # Leader joint 4 -> Follower joint 5
    5: 4  # Leader joint 5 -> Follower joint 4

    - 0.0   # No offsets
    - 0.0
    - 0.0
    - 0.0

# Example 2: Mirror operation
# Mirror the leader robot for symmetric operation
mirror_example:
  joint_mapping:
    0: 0   # Base stays same
    1: 1   # Shoulder stays same
    2: 2   # Elbow stays same
    3: 3   # Wrist roll stays same
    4: 4   # Wrist pitch stays same
    5: 5   # Wrist yaw stays same

    - [-1.0, 0.0,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0]   # Flip base
    - [0.0,  1.0,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0]   # Keep shoulder

    - [0.0,  0.0,  0.0,  1.0,  0.0,  0.0]   # Keep wrist roll
    - [0.0,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0, -1.0,  0.0]   # Flip wrist pitch
    - [0.0,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0,  0.0,  1.0]   # Keep wrist yaw

# Example 3: Calibration offsets
# Add offsets to compensate for different zero positions
calibration_example:
  joint_offsets:
    - 0.087   # 5 degrees offset for base
    - -0.175  # -10 degrees offset for shoulder
    - 0.262   # 15 degrees offset for elbow
    - -0.087  # -5 degrees offset for wrist roll
    - 0.175   # 10 degrees offset for wrist pitch
    - 0.0     # No offset for wrist yaw

# Example 4: Complex transformation with everything
# Reorder + scale + offset
